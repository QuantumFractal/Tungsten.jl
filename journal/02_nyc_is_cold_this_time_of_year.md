# NYC is cold this time of year

Dear reader, long time no see. In this issue of the "blog that literally no one will read", I'm talking about my week in New York City. The Big Apple.

Flew out for Halloween and stayed the week after, we got a place in Brooklyn. Getting to the place was slightly hellish, we flew in on a Friday into Newark and had an 1.5 hour Uber ride through Manhattan. Did I mention it was hellish? Anyways, we got settled in and ordered some food. We stayed in Bed-Stuy, and since it's a historically Black neighborhood, we got a Black owned Air-BnB. I felt a little bad because I realized the host owned the building and lived below the rental unit. I can be notoriously stompy, but fortunately the review mentioned that we were "quiet"!

The neighborhood was super walkable (especially when compared to Sunnyvale) and also has great food. A good mix of "southern comfort" food and Afro-caribbean. My girlfriend felt right at home since she lived in Peckham, London while going to university. The next morning we grabbed Metro cards, and headed to Manhattan to catch a movie at a boutique theatre.

We ended up going out for Halloween, getting some pizza and hanging out with friends. We worked from home (worked from airBnB?) the week after, and I took some time to venture back to Manhattan by myself to see the USS Intrepid Museum. It's a big frickin' air craft carrier, built in 1941, and retired in 1974. Lots of fun stuff to explore on board, tons of pipes and wires running along the walls. All I could think to myself, how the heck did they build and maintain all this? 

Well I'm not a boat expert. Guessing there's some kind of sea magic that just makes these things work. Same for software development, any "software management" book will put me to sleep, and anyone who tries to tell you they know how it works is lying. So anyways, Software development is that murky boundary between technical and social. You're fighting against time, your coworkers, yourself, the compiler, social norms, etc. It's hard to measure, and regiment, because it's like trying to take boot measurements at a square dance, things are happening, the vibe is great and you're the dude trying to measure people's shoes in the middle.

Solo Development is like constantly fighting your past and future selves. You're making up for the past mistakes, and trying to clear the way for future you to push past your current mistakes. No code reviews, no Agile sprints, just raw ego. 

Anyways, I'm not editing these, and you cannot make me.
