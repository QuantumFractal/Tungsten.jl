# History Rhymes

Dear reader, has this ever happened to you? You're a programmer, a coder, a CSS ninja, what ever, and you happen to play video games as well. And you think to yourself "holy shit, I can program, and games are basically big programs, I can make a game!" Then you try to install Visual Studio 2008 because all the AAA games are made with C++ and you're not quite familiar with C++, but hey it's basically C right? Then you slog through OpenGL for the first time, and you get that first glorious triangle on the screen. Hell, you don't even have GLFW event handling setup correctly, so you have to open Task Manager and kill your precious program manually. 


Maybe something happens after that, maybe nothing at all. If you're like me, you'll get some textures drawn, maybe do some physics and camera work, then realize this is totally sucking up a lot of your time, and that making the next Minecraft isn't going to earn you that Computer Engineering degree. And you give up. Well let me tell you a secret, I've been trying to make a god damned game since I was in highschool and I have probably tried to start that process dozens of times over the years. Maybe I lacked the grit, maybe I had better things to do.


You know what they say, "History doesn't repeat itself, but it often rhymes". So maybe this time I'll get further than a spinning cube. Or this repo will be dropped like a hot potato and will forever be a testament to the folly of programmerkind.

Stay in school,
Tom
